# Truncation Nation - Hack4Change
<b>Hack4Change Hackathon</b>
DataLink is a hackathon - an event where you have less than 24 hours to perform data analysis on public datasets. Compete to perform analysis to test your theories and write a report on your findings before the time is up!

## About us
We are 4 3rd year Computer Science with Data Science scholars at UCD, with a keen interest in statistical data analytics. As proficient Python programmers, we felt it was only natural to use Jupyter Notebooks as the environment for our analysis.

## Can we find a correlation between air travel and Covid related incidents?
Our group wanted to examine the relationship between air travel and Covid cases and
deaths. In particular we wanted to discover what impact air travel had on Covid cases
and deaths. We were also interested in finding how counties which had airports were
affected by Covid versus counties which do not have airports. Surprisingly we found that
the reducing levels of air travel did not lead to similar trends in the levels of Covid cases
in Ireland.
